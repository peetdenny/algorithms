## Algorithms & Datastructures

My implementation of several popular algorithms, 
that I've put together as part of some courses I've been taking.
Including:

* Karger's Graph Minimum Cut
* Karatsuba's O(n log(n)) long multiplication 
* Mergesort
* Inversion counting (in Python and Go) 
* Quicksort
